I. Project Description
I created Project Op-Ed for the reasons below: 
- learning and practing web scraping with Scwapy
- I enjoy reading Op-Eds. The problems is news sites are converging to social media -- a personal loan ad here and a shopping link there. By scraping the titles, I create a clean daily reading experience for myself and potentially others. In addition, I hope to create a textual dataset of via Op-Eds across publications to track public opinions on Economy and Politics. 

II. Features and Limitations
1. Scrape the titles of Op-Eds on https://www.nytimes.com/section/opinion [done]
2. Scrape the titles of Op-Eds on other media sites and combine into one file [TBD]
3. Page-Flipping Spider [TBD]
4. Add hyperlink to Op-Ed titles [TBD]
5. Track comments and assign a friend-foe-bully score [TBD]
